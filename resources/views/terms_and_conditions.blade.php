        <h5 class="card-title">1. Downpayment:</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          To secure and confirm your reservation at Life Project 4 Youth GuestHouse, a downpayment is required. The downpayment amount is set at a minimum of 15% of the total reservation cost. This downpayment acts as a commitment fee, ensuring the availability of your chosen accommodation for the specified dates. It's important to note that the downpayment is non-refundable, serving as a guarantee of your intention to proceed with the reservation.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">2. Full Payment Procedures:</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Upon arrival and check-in at the guesthouse, guests are kindly requested to settle the remaining balance in full. Payment can be made in cash or by credit card, providing flexibility for our guests. In the event of a cancellation, a refund is possible, albeit with a 50% deduction from the total payment. This policy is in place to account for administrative and logistical considerations associated with cancellations, allowing us to maintain the high standards of service our guests expect.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">3. Reservation Changes:</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          We understand that plans may change, and we are happy to accommodate reasonable adjustments to reservation dates or times. Guests are encouraged to communicate any changes at least 24 hours before the scheduled check-in. However, such changes are subject to the availability of rooms during the requested period. We strive to be as flexible as possible, ensuring our guests can enjoy a hassle-free and enjoyable stay with us.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">4. Refund and Cancellation:</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Downpayments are non-refundable to compensate for the reserved space and resources. In the case of full payments, a 50% refund is applicable in the event of cancellation. The remaining 50% is retained by the guesthouse as a cancellation fee, covering administrative costs and potential loss of business due to the canceled reservation. This policy allows us to maintain competitive pricing while providing a fair approach to cancellations.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">5. Check-Out and Stay Duration:</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Guests are kindly requested to check out between Tuesday and Saturday. Our maximum allowable stay is set at 4 nights. This duration is designed to accommodate a rotating clientele, allowing us to provide a comfortable and enjoyable experience for all guests. Extensions beyond this period can be discussed with the front desk, taking into consideration the availability of rooms and ensuring a seamless transition for our guests.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">6. Changing Reservation Dates:</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Guests may request changes to reservation dates, depending on room availability. For date changes, we recommend contacting the guesthouse management well in advance to facilitate a smooth transition. We understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, and we aim to provide the necessary flexibility to accommodate our guests' needs while ensuring an efficient and well-organized operation.
