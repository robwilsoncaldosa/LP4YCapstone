# LP4YCapstone
I add a sql to import 

# 1.Open PhPmyadmmin and then click import

# 2.Choose the sql format here

# 3.If there is an error maybe you need to create a database named "Lp4ywebsite"

# 4.In the .env file change the database to Lp4ywebsite so that the project will know what database to fetch the data from
